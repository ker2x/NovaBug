CMake Warning (dev) at C:/Users/kerde/AppData/Local/JetBrains/Toolbox/apps/CLion/ch-0/223.7571.171/bin/cmake/win/share/cmake-3.24/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:438 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (VORBIS)
  does not match the name of the calling package (Vorbis).  This can lead to
  problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
  (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  SFML/cmake/Modules/FindVorbis.cmake:25 (find_package_handle_standard_args)
  SFML/cmake/Macros.cmake:279 (find_package)
  SFML/src/SFML/Audio/CMakeLists.txt:70 (sfml_find_package)
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:17 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindSFML.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "SFML", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "SFML" with any of
  the following names:

    SFMLConfig.cmake
    sfml-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "SFML" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "SFML_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "SFML"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
